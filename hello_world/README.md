# iOS App Cheat sheet

Building an app requires that you have a clear understanding of relevant concepts needed to start with development. The following concepts will help you get started in development.

### AppDelegate

Building an app requires that you have a clear understanding of relevant concepts needed to start with development. The following concepts will help you get started in development.

### SceneDelegate

Starting from iOS 13 and later, SceneDelegate takes some responsibilities from AppDelegate. SceneDelegate is responsible for what’s displayed on the screen in terms of user interface (UI) and data.

### ViewControllers

ViewControllers present content users can interact with on the screen. These are the only components that deliver interactive content to the user. A ViewController represents something an application can do, and an application often “does” several things – meaning, most applications provide more than one ViewController.

### UIViews

In iOS, UIViews are almost indivisible elements that draw themselves to the screen. They can display images, text and more. A combination of all these views forms a design interface that serves a purpose for the user.

### Storyboard file

In XCode, each storyboard is represented by a .storyboard (dot storyboard) file. These user interface files serve as blueprints for the interface that an application presents to the user.

### Project files

Xcode project files belong to one of three main categories: configuration, code, and resource. Configuration files define the project structure, code files provide the logic, and resource files are pretty much everything else.
